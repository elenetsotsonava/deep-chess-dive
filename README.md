# ♟ Chess Games Analysis Project

This project explores patterns and insights in a large dataset of chess games, focusing on identifying the most successful openings, visualizing player performance, and presenting findings through clean and informative visualizations.

## 📊 Project Goals

1. **Analyze the most successful chess openings**  
   - Identify the most frequently used openings.
   - Determine which openings result in the highest win rates.

2. **Visualize player performance**  
   - Explore how player ratings and colors (white/black) affect performance.
   - Visualize rating distributions and win percentages.

3. **Present findings through clear dashboards and charts**  
   - Use well-documented code to generate interactive and static visualizations using Python libraries.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (for development)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- numpy

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Chess Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess)
- Contains ~20,000 chess game records with metadata such as player ratings, game results, and opening names.

## 🔍 Key Analyses

- 📈 Bar charts of most common vs. most successful openings.
- 🧩 Win rate comparison based on player color.
- 📊 Rating distribution and correlation with game outcomes.
- 🎯 Insights into player behavior and strategies.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the provided Colab notebook: [Chess Analysis Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your_colab_link_here)  
3. Upload the dataset or link it from Kaggle.
4. Run all cells to reproduce the visualizations and insights.

## ✅ Results

- Discovered that popularity of an opening doesn't necessarily mean it's the most successful.
- Found patterns in rating influence and color advantage.
- Highlighted which openings yield better results across different rating groups.

## 🧼 Data Cleaning

During preprocessing, unnecessary columns were dropped, and some values were filtered to improve analysis accuracy. The dataset was cleaned and prepared using pandas.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Include time control filtering (blitz, rapid, bullet).
- Analyze player performance by country (if data available).
- Create a Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration.
